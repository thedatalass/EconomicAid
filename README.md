# EconomicAid

Abstract— foreign assistance has the potential to promote America’s interests, improves lives abroad and contribute to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. What if decision makers could use data science techniques to predict an approximation of how much aid they would receive? Countries could plan for the future by knowing how much aid they will receive. Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithms were used to predict economic aid amount categories using U.S. Agency for International Development historical data. All classifiers outperformed the baseline accuracy by at least 7%.

Data: Country-level data from 177 countries from 2014-2016.
