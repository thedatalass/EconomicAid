*Show me the Money: Forecasting Economic Aid with Machine Learning*

__Abstract__— foreign assistance has the potential to promote America’s interests, improves lives abroad and contribute to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. What if decision makers could use data science techniques to predict an approximation of how much aid they would receive? Countries could plan for the future by knowing how much aid they will receive. Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithms were used to predict economic aid amount categories using U.S. Agency for International Development historical data. All classifiers outperformed the baseline accuracy by at least 7%.

__Data__: 2014-2016 Country-level data from 176 countries with threefeatures and one target (Aid Amount > $10 million>.

__Results__: Decision tree prediction accuracy was 91.47%, k-Nearest Neighbor with 10-fold cross validation prediction accuracy was 93.19% and Naive Bayes prediction accuracy was 90.91%.
